			<p class="howW">
			Manga Spot started with just two people who really like manga, Bob and Joe. While buying manga and increasing collection, we found that we wanted more room for different series we wanted to collect and also had some series we didn't want in our collection anymore, giving us the idea for Manga Spot. We thought it would be a good idea to have a website similar to ebay but soley dedicated to our favorite hobby, manga.
